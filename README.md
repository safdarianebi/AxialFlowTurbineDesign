# AxialFlowTurbineDesign
**Design of Axial Flow Turbine**

- The aim is developing a Python code for turbine design and providing turbine geometric specifications.
- "loss_functions" file calculates pressure losses and parasitic losses in axial flow turbines.
- "air_thermodynamic_properties" provides thermodynamic properties of air as a thermally perfect gas.
